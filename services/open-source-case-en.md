# Open-Source Business Cases
## Mature Business Models in the Open-Source Domain
### Subscription model
 The subscription service model, which emphasizes "service over software," represents a brand-new business model adopted by open-source software companies, shifting from the traditional commercial software approach that focuses on "products" as the selling point to prioritizing "services." First, the subscription service model allows users to maintain access to the software through regular payments, rather than paying a high one-time purchase fee. This payment method not only reduces the initial investment burden for enterprises in their early development stages but also ensures continuous software updates and technical support. As business needs change, enterprise users can flexibly choose to increase or decrease service content, or adjust service levels, achieving optimal resource allocation.Second, the subscription service model usually includes automatic update services, enabling enterprise users to access the latest and improved features at any time without paying additional update fees. This model not only ensures the security of the software and keeps it at the latest version, but also enhances the operational efficiency of enterprises.In conclusion, the subscription service model reflects a strategic evolution in the open-source software industry, emphasizing the establishment of long-term customer relationships and stable revenue streams through services rather than merely software sales.






### Dual licensing model
The dual-licensing model is an open-source software distribution strategy that allows software authors to release their software under both an open-source license and a proprietary license, providing users and developers with flexible choices.
In this model, first, users can, based on their own needs and preferences, choose to use the community distribution version under the open-source license. Second, they can opt to purchase the commercial distribution version under the proprietary license, gaining access to additional features, support, and services.


One of the design purposes of the dual-licensing model is to strike a balance between open-source and commercialization. This model allows the integration of open-source code and proprietary code, enabling enterprises to integrate their own proprietary code into open-source software, add new functions, optimize performance, etc., so as to make the product more in line with their own business needs. For the self-developed proprietary code part of an enterprise, it can be licensed for use through commercial licensing to protect its own intellectual property rights. The open-source part can attract developers' attention and adoption, while the proprietary part provides value-added services for enterprise users, with the two complementing each other. Reusing open-source code can avoid the high cost of developing from scratch, and the proprietary part can meet customized needs.

Three fundamental features in the dual-licensing model 
- The license for the open-source version is typically a strongly restrictive one, i.e., a copyleft-type open-source license. Such licenses aim to safeguard the source code freedom of downstream users, so they generally prohibit users from keeping modified open-source code closed-source or changing the license.
- Under the dual-licensing model, the core product code may not only come from the independent research and development of software companies but also from open-source contributions. Therefore, when enterprises conduct commercial licensing, they need to avoid intellectual property disputes through means such as intellectual property transfer or code rewriting. 
- Software adopting a dual-licensing model typically accumulates a substantial free user base in its early stages. As open-source communities expand their reach, new use cases and users gradually emerge. Notable examples of this licensing approach include MySQL, Redis, and Qt, with most being database-related technologies.


### Open-Core Model
 The open-core model combines the openness of open-source software with the commercial aspects of proprietary software. In this model, the base version or core function of the software is open-source and freely available for users to use and modify. Meanwhile, the company also develops additional premium features or services that require payment.This approach offers two key advantages:1.Community Growth: The company attracts a broad user group for its foundational open-source product, fostering an active community. 2.Sustainable Revenue: By offering paid add-ons or services, the company generates income to support ongoing development and improvements.

   A prime example of this model is Databricks and GitLab. Databricks builds upon the open-source Apache Spark platform while offering premium commercial services that extend beyond the core open-source functionality. These value-added services include optimized data processing, machine learning libraries, and enterprise-grade security support - all designed to appeal to enterprise customers willing to pay for enhanced capabilities.Similarly, GitLab offers its core version as open-source, providing essential features like version control and continuous integration, while its commercial edition includes advanced project management tools, security testing, and performance monitoring capabilities. This strategy allows GitLab to build its user base and brand trust through the free open-source offering, while generating revenue through premium proprietary features and services—effectively combining the innovative power of open-source communities with the revenue potential of commercial products.

### SaaS Model
 

 The typical representatives of this model are **Databricks** and **GitLab**. Databricks, built on the open-source Apache Spark, offers advanced commercial services beyond basic open-source features, such as optimized data processing, machine learning libraries, and enterprise-grade security support, to attract enterprise users to pay. Similarly, GitLab open-sources its core version, providing basic functions like version control and continuous integration, while its commercial version includes advanced project management tools, security testing, and performance monitoring. By offering a free open-source version to build a user base and brand trust, and generating profits through selling value-added proprietary features and services, it combines the innovation of the open-source community with the profitability of commercial products.

### App Store model

The app store model is a business model that facilitates transactions by creating a platform, allowing developers and users to buy and sell plug-ins, applications, or other services. The key to the success of this model lies in building an active community and an efficient trading platform, enabling users to easily find and purchase the value-added services they need, while also providing developers with a channel to display and sell their products.

### Embedded advertising model
The embedded advertising model is an innovative business strategy where software vendors embed advertisements as part of their software products. Leveraging the rapid promotion of open-source software, the embedded ads within the software achieve wide dissemination, thereby forming a closed loop of the commercial ecosystem. As open-source software reaches a broader audience, the ads embedded in it are consequently spread to a more extensive user base. Advertisers, having achieved the effect of product promotion, are more willing to place ads with software vendors. In turn, the profits gained by software vendors enable them to continue investing in the development of open-source software, thus creating a positive cycle.


### Hardware-Bundling Model
The hardware-bundling model refers to a business approach that combines open-source software with hardware products for bundle sales. In this model, companies tightly couple open-source software with their proprietary hardware offerings, using hardware as the primary revenue driver while positioning the open-source components as value-added differentiators to enhance the overall solution's appeal. This creates a profitable synergy between the two elements. A prime example of this strategy is IBM, which has successfully implemented this hybrid approach.

Since the 1990s, IBM has made significant investments in open-source technologies, including the Linux operating system, Apache Web Server, and Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IBM's hardware-and-open-source-software bundling model is primarily reflected in the following aspects:
1. Servers Bundled with Linux

IBM integrates its server products with the Linux operating system, offering customers a one-stop hardware and software solution. By delivering high-performance Linux-based servers, IBM competes for market share while reducing procurement and deployment costs for clients—generating substantial revenue in the process.

2. Storage Devices Bundled with Open-Source Software

IBM pairs its storage systems with open-source distributed file systems such as GPFS and Lustre, providing high-performance, highly reliable data storage solutions.

3. Cloud Computing Bundled with Open-Source Middleware

IBM’s cloud computing offerings incorporate a wide range of open-source middleware, including OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Apache Kafka, delivering out-of-the-box cloud services to users.

### Red Hat：Open-source commercialization Breakthrough
Red Hat is the world's leading provider of enterprise open-source solutions. Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, the company is a constituent of the S&P 500 index with over 20,000 employees and more than 100 subsidiaries operating globally. Its core offerings include enterprise operating systems (RHEL), cloud computing platforms (OpenShift), storage solutions (Ceph Storage), middleware (JBoss), and automation tools (Ansible). In 2018, IBM completed its acquisition of Red Hat for $34 billion, a strategic move that significantly enhanced IBM's capabilities in hybrid cloud and open-source technologies. The acquisition represents one of the largest technology deals in history and solidified Red Hat's position as a cornerstone of modern enterprise IT infrastructure.

Red Hat has established itself as the "textbook case" of open-source commercialization, pioneering the business model paradigm of "open-source products + subscription services." Since its founding in 1993, the company has successfully transformed free open-source technology into commercial offerings by providing enterprise-grade support, security patches, and system maintenance services.

This innovative model effectively addressed enterprises' concerns about adopting open-source software in production environments. By 2019, Red Hat generated $1.01 billion in operating cash flow, with deferred revenue accounting for a significant portion—reflecting the stability of its subscription-based approach.

Financially, subscription services dominated Red Hat's revenue structure (87.7% in FY2019), followed by consulting and training (12.3%). The company reported $3.362 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2019, representing 15.1% year-over-year growth, while maintaining a stable gross margin of 85%.

Red Hat has built differentiated market competitiveness through its "open-source community + enterprise services" dual-engine business model:
- “Free software, paid services": The software's source code is open-source and free, while revenue relies on subscription-based technical support. For example, RHEL users need a subscription to access security updates, compatibility certifications, and 24/7 support.

- Technology Integration Path: Transforming community innovations (such as the Linux kernel and Kubernetes) into enterprise-grade products through a three-phase approach of "Project-Integration-Platform." For example, OpenShift integrates containers, automation, and cloud-native technologies.

- Hybrid cloud positioning: serving as a bridge between enterprise private clouds and public clouds.

- Ecosystem neutrality: maintaining compatibility with multiple cloud providers to avoid vendor lock-in.

Red Hat’s success demonstrates that open source is not anti-commercial; rather, it establishes a new logic for value creation. Its core approach lies in precisely identifying the pain points of enterprise users—the need for stability and security in production environments—and addressing them through professional services. This paradigm provides a foundational reference framework for the commercialization of subsequent open-source companies.

### PingCAP：Global Expansion of Open-Source Databases
PingCAP, founded in 2015, is a leading global provider of enterprise-level open-source distributed databases. Its mission is to empower developers and enterprises through technology, driving the maximization of data value and digital transformation. The product portfolio centers on TiDB and covers OLTP (Online Transaction Processing), OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and HTAP (Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing) scenarios, supporting cloud-native deployment and a MySQL-compatible ecosystem. With nine branches worldwide—including China, the United States, and Japan—PingCAP serves over 3,000 enterprises across more than 20 countries, spanning key sectors such as finance (Bank of China, Ping An Life), Internet (JD.com, Xiaomi), and Web3 （NFTScan）

Unlike Red Hat’s service-subscription model, PingCAP has pioneered a hybrid business approach of “open-source core + cloud services + ecosystem value-added offerings.” In 2023, it generated $35 million in revenue, up 94.4% year-on-year, with the Chinese market growing 100%. Overseas markets accounted for over 50% of revenue, making PingCAP the highest-grossing Chinese open-source software company. By 2024, its valuation reached $3 billion, establishing it as China’s largest open-source unicorn.


PingCAP’s success is built first and foremost on a strong foundation of open-source community management. TiDB has earned over 38,000 stars on GitHub and brings together nearly 900 contributors from around the world. This community-driven development model not only accelerates product iteration but also serves as a natural channel for customer education. PingCAP’s co-founder and CTO, Huang Dongxu, regards the open-source community as “the best customer acquisition engine”—through community discussions, the technical team can understand user needs, while the product’s quality and reputation spread organically among developers, significantly reducing the high customer acquisition costs typical of traditional enterprise software sales.

Another strategic highlight of PingCAP is its dual-track approach to international and domestic markets. In its early stages, the company targeted Chinese Internet enterprises, with gaming company Gaia Interactive becoming its first paying customer. These high-concurrency, data-intensive scenarios provided an ideal environment to refine TiDB. As the product matured, PingCAP quickly expanded overseas, establishing a customer base in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and South Asia, with international revenue now surpassing domestic earnings.

PingCAP has successfully carved out a position in the distributed database market through a model of “open-source–driven innovation, subscription-based revenue assurance, and cloud-service–driven market expansion.” Its core moat lies in technological leadership and a positive feedback loop within its community ecosystem, while future challenges will focus on deeper penetration into global markets and competitive displacement in traditional industries.

PingCAP’s case demonstrates that open source is the most effective market entry strategy in the global foundational software sector. Through community-driven product iteration and a globally collaborative network, Chinese open-source companies are fully capable of achieving technological breakthroughs in core foundational software such as databases, transforming local innovation into global competitiveness. Its positive feedback loop of “product–community–commercialization” provides a replicable growth framework for the next generation of open-source enterprises.

### Google: Leading the Open-Source Ecosystem

Google, founded in 1998 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, is a leading global technology company. It employs over 180,000 people and operates in more than 150 countries worldwide. Its core businesses include search (Google Search), cloud computing (Google Cloud), open-source operating systems (Android), browsers (Chrome), AI frameworks (TensorFlow), and large models (Gemma). Notably, projects such as AOSP, Kubernetes, Chrome, and TensorFlow are among Google’s globally renowned open-source initiatives.

From a business strategy perspective, Android is Google’s most successful open-source brand. While AOSP (Android Open Source Project) is the true open-source project and Android itself cannot be strictly considered open source, in the public mind, Android has become synonymous with open source. In practice, Google has successfully implemented an “open core + closed services” business model. On one hand, it uses open source to freely license device manufacturers, rapidly expanding its market and capturing share previously held by iOS. On the other hand, through GMS (Google Mobile Services), it provides closed, value-added services, tightly controlling the ecosystem and generating revenue from pre-installation licensing fees and ad sharing. According to reports, Android generated $31 billion in annual revenue for Google in 2016, of which $22 billion was net profit.

In the browser arena, since 2005 Google has supported the open-source Mozilla Firefox, paying Mozilla roughly $400–450 million annually to ensure Google remains the default search engine on Firefox, thereby securing a closed traffic loop. On the other hand, Google ultimately decided to develop its own browser, Chrome, which gradually caught up with and eventually surpassed Firefox in market share, becoming the ultimate winner in the browser space. The logic behind this strategy remains rooted in traffic control and advertising revenue.

In the cloud computing sector, Google’s open-source projects have also been impressive, yet they have failed to achieve the kind of success seen with its operating system or browser. According to Gartner, Google Cloud’s global market share was only 5.3% in 2019, compared with 45% for AWS and 17.9% for Azure. Even by 2025, Google Cloud’s share is expected to reach just 10–12%. The reasons behind this are quite revealing. Many analyses point to Google’s engineer-driven culture, which often overlooks enterprise pain points, as well as a structural lack of ToB (business-to-business) service capabilities as the primary cause. Additionally, critical missed acquisitions—GitHub and Red Hat, which were acquired by Microsoft and IBM respectively—and lagging channel development have also been key factors.

In short, adopting an open-source strategy does not guarantee success, even for a tech giant like Google, which understands and leverages open source better than most.

### Huawei: From Closed to Open Ecosystem

Huawei was founded in 1987, but for a long time, it placed a strong emphasis on “information security,” particularly on protecting internal intellectual property and source code from leaks. Its approach to open source was cautious and conservative. It wasn’t until 2008 that Huawei established the Open Source Competence Center, aimed at standardizing the use and management of open-source software. According to The Open Source Mindset by Huawei’s Chief Open Source Officer, Ren Xudong, Huawei’s engagement with open source can be divided into four development stages.
- Before 2009: Focused on the standardized use of open-source software, transitioning from spontaneous adoption to a more orderly approach. On top of ensuring compliance, greater attention was given to the security of open-source software.

- 2010-2014：Marked by Huawei’s joining the Linux Foundation in 2010, this period saw active participation in open-source communities and the development of an open-source strategic management system. During this time, Huawei also joined key organizations such as the Apache Software Foundation, the OpenStack Foundation, and the Linaro Foundation, and in 2014 formally established a company-wide open-source strategy management framework.

- 2015–2017: Continued to deepen open-source contributions, establish external open-source management systems and teams, and actively explore open-sourcing. In 2015, Huawei participated as a founding member in the establishment of the CNCF; in 2016, Huawei proactively open-sourced LiteOS, and in the following years, initiated and contributed to an increasing number of open-source projects.

- 2018–Present: Maintained strong contributions, continuously optimized open-source processes, and accelerated the incubation of major open-source projects. Beyond the company’s own shift from closed to open practices, external pressures from the U.S. also played a significant role in prompting Huawei to embrace open source more proactively.


The timeline of U.S. sanctions against Huawei is as follows: On June 7, 2018, the U.S. Congress urged Google to halt cooperation with Huawei. On May 15, 2019, then-President Donald Trump issued an executive order prohibiting the use of information and communication technologies and services from “adversary” countries, authorizing the U.S. Department of Commerce to enforce it. On the same day, the Department of Commerce and its Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced specific measures to implement the order, adding Huawei to the Entity List. On May 19, 2019, Google removed Huawei devices from its Android upgrade list and announced the suspension of Google Mobile Services (GMS), including Google Play, Gmail, Google Maps, and other apps and services. On July 16, 2019, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced 5G legislation that effectively blacklisted Huawei.

By August 2019, Huawei officially unveiled its HarmonyOS at the Huawei Developer Conference. Building on this momentum, on June 15, 2020, with joint efforts from multiple parties—including Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, Inspur, 360, Tencent, and China Merchants Bank—the OpenAtom Foundation was registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, becoming China’s first independent non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the open-source industry for public benefit. Later that year, on September 10, Huawei’s OpenHarmony operating system was open-sourced and donated to the OpenAtom Foundation.

By January 31, 2025, the community had amassed over 8,200 contributors, 130 million lines of code, and 401 ecosystem partners, including 63 member organizations. Through continuous technological innovation and ecosystem development, the community has driven the creation of a full-scenario operating system, spanning key sectors such as finance, education, healthcare, transportation, and industry. On May 8, 2025, Huawei also officially launched the HarmonyOS-powered PC. Within just 15 hours of opening for pre-orders, over 50,000 people had reserved the MateBook Fold “Extraordinary Master” edition on Huawei’s online store.

Another notable Huawei open-source project is openEuler. It originated from EulerOS, an internal operating system development project Huawei launched in 2010, primarily for servers, storage, and other ICT products. On December 31, 2019, Huawei open-sourced EulerOS and rebranded it as openEuler, marking the birth of a new open-source community aimed at diverse computing scenarios. In November 2021, Huawei contributed openEuler to the OpenAtom Foundation, entering a stage of industry-wide co-construction. Today, openEuler has grown into one of the most vibrant open-source OS communities globally. By December 2024, cumulative installations of openEuler exceeded 10 million, with a market share of 36.8% in China’s server market. According to the latest statistics (July 2025), openEuler now has 4.15 million users, 22,000 contributors, and 2,073 member organizations.

For Huawei’s open-source business case, we can summarize as follows: a pragmatic business philosophy has guided Huawei from a closed approach to an open one, while resolute strategic execution has yielded a thriving open-source ecosystem.


## Summary


The cases of Red Hat, Google, PingCAP, and Huawei demonstrate that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to open-source commercialization. Each company has forged its own path, shaped by its unique strengths and objectives.


Open-source commercialization is essentially a “value reconfiguration driven by open innovation.” Whether a company starts with open source as its core business, like Red Hat or PingCAP, or integrates open source into a broader corporate strategy, like Google or Huawei, the key lies in aligning open-source technologies with the company’s own resources and market objectives. At the same time, open source is a double-edged sword. Google’s relatively modest cloud market share shows that even the companies that understand open source best can struggle in the B2B market if they overlook the deeper needs of enterprise services. Looking ahead, finding the optimal balance between open collaboration and sustainable profitability—especially for Chinese open-source initiatives pursuing globalization and technological self-reliance—remains an ongoing challenge. Ultimately, the success of open source does not depend on whether the code is open, but on whether the power of openness can be harnessed to create unique business value.
